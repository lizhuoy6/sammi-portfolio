## Project Overview

**The product:** 
ForTickets is a ticket booking app for movies. It allows you to book tickets and split the bill, and you can also buy food for your movie so you don’t have to wait in line at the theater.

**Project duration:**
108 Days

**The problem:**
People find it hard to split the bill after purchasing movie tickets.
It is hard to order food while in a movie as you may have to wait in line and miss important actions.

**The goal:**
To build an app with split the bill feature baked in. While also allowing users to order food ahead of the movie so they can be delivered to their seat.

**My role:**
Lead UX designer and researcher

**Responsibilities:**
Conduct user research, build wireframes, low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes on Figma.

## User Research

### Research Goals

1. To understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the movie ticket app I’m designing.
2. To understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem the movie ticket app is trying to solve.
3. To identify common user behaviors and experiences with tasks that the movie ticket app is trying to address.

### Interview Questions

1. Can you describe how you currently order a movie ticket in the app?
2. How often do you order food from the movie theater? When you do, what is your motivation for doing so?
3. What challenges do you face in the payment method process? How does this make you feel?
4. Is there any way in which you feel these challenges could be resolved?

### Target Participant Characteristics

- Ages 16-60
- Lives in GTA areas,fluents in English
- People who goes to theater to watch movie at lease once a month
- Include participants of different genders
- Include participants with disabilities

I have recruited 25 participants for the survey and 10 for the interviews.In order to consolidate feedback from users,I have also aggregated the user empathy maps.It helps me go through the steps and break down each interview into digestible pieces of information.

**Summary of the User Interviews**

I conduct user interviews in order to create personas/empathy maps to better understand the user I am designing for and their needs.One of my primary user group are students who wants to split the bill for their ticket purchases frequently. This group confirmed the need for a bill splitting feature with in the app. But I also found that sometimes bills are not split evenly, and there are potential design challenges when splitting the bill to a large number of people. I will list the poin points and user needs in the next user analysis part.

## User Analysis

### User Pain Points

1. **Cannot split bill within the app:** Young people usually watch movies together with their friends. And in most cases, have to split the bill afterwards on a different platform.

2. **Cannot order food during the movie:** During the movie, users usually have to walk out and buy food and drink.

3. **Hard to pick optimal seats when purchasing tickets:** When selecting seats, it is very hard to know which row has the most optimal viewing experience.

4. **Need a way to be alerted when a movie I want to watch goes on air:** If user don’t keep track the the movie they want to watch, it is hard to know when they go on air.

### Create Personas

Based on my research findings, I built the proto persona to stay anchored on the users to avoid letting our desire for features trump the user's need.

### Craft User Story

**User story one: Christina Lee**

Christina is a high school student who usually watches movie with her friends after school. They usually split the bill, however most ticketing apps doesn’t have this functionality built in. So they have to use third-party solutions. She also needs to share the ticket with her friends so they can keep a copy, at the moment she usually just do a screenshot and send it to her friends.

**User story two: Patrick Grey**

Patrick is thirty years old and working as a film critic.Recently Patrick’s studio want to review a movie, but they have no idea when that movie will be out in their area. The whole studio just keeps checking the app until the movie comes out. So much lost productivity.

**User story three: Primble Graham**

Primble is a uber driver who loves watching movie in the theater.One day,he watches a movie in the theatre and feels hungry.He then goes out and orders some popcorn and coke, lines up for over 10 minutes and misses the scene where the protagonist got shot.He has to rewatch the movie again at home.

### Problem Statements Based on Personas

1. Christina is a high school student who needs to split the bill easily with her friend because she usually pre-pay the tickets for the group.
2. Patrick is a film critic who needs to know the exact release time of the latest movie because his studio wants to review it at the first second.
3. Pimble is a uber driver who needs to purchase popcorn and coke during a movie because he might miss important action if he go out and buy food.

### Competitive Audit

A comprehansivee competitive audit was carried out on 4 products: Cineplex, Imagine Cinemas, Ticket Master and SeatGeek.

### Build Goal Statements

1. Our Fortickets app will let users split the bill which will affect users who purchases tickets for their friends by letting them split their bill directly in the app. We will measure effectiveness by tracking number of users who use the split the bill feature.

2. Our Fortickets app will let users order food in advance in the app which will affect uses who want to enjoy food during their movies by letting users order in advance and saving times. We will measure effectiveness by comparing number of users purchase through the app vs users order the food in person.

3. Our Fortickets app will let users get notifications when a movie starts airing which will affect users who are passionate about a specific movie by letting them get notification instead of manually refreshing the page menu. We will measure effectiveness by calculating number of notifications user received.

- Existing movie ticketing apps doesn’t allow users to mark movies as their favourites or watched.
- It is important to have large “Buy Ticket” button as it is the primary action a user wants to take.
