## Project Overview

**The product:** 
ForTickets is a ticket-booking app for movies. It allows you to book tickets and split the bill, and you can also buy food for your movie so you don’t have to wait in line at the theater.

**Project duration:**
108 Days

**The problem:**
People find it hard to split the bill after purchasing movie tickets.
It is hard to order food while in a movie as you may have to wait in line and miss important actions.

**The goal:**
To build an app with a split-the-bill feature baked in. While also allowing users to order food ahead of the movie so they can be delivered to their seats.

**My role:**
Lead UX designer and researcher

**Responsibilities:**
Conduct user research, build wireframes, low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes on Figma.

## User Research

<img src="/images/fortickets/userresearch.png" style="float: right" width="400" />

### Research Goals

1. To understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the movie ticket app I’m designing.
2. To understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem the movie ticket app is trying to solve.
3. To identify common user behaviors and experiences with tasks that the movie ticket app is trying to address.

### Interview Questions

1. Can you describe how you currently order a movie ticket in the app?
2. How often do you order food from the movie theater? When you do, what is your motivation for doing so?
3. What challenges do you face in the payment method process? How does this make you feel?
4. Is there any way in which you feel these challenges could be resolved?

### Target Participant Characteristics

- Aged 16-60
- Lives in GTA area, fluent in English
- People who go to the theater to watch a movie at least once a month
- Include participants of different genders
- Include participants with disabilities

I have recruited 25 participants for the survey and 10 for the interviews. To consolidate feedback from users, I have also aggregated the user empathy maps. It helps me go through the steps and break down each interview into digestible pieces of information.

**Summary of the User Interviews**

I conducted user interviews in order to create personas/empathy maps to better understand the user I am designing for and their needs. One of my primary user group are students who want to split the bill for their ticket purchases frequently. This group confirmed the need for a bill-splitting feature with in the app. But I also found that sometimes bills are not split evenly, and there are potential design challenges when splitting the bill to a large number of people. I will list the pain points and user needs in the next user analysis part.

## User Analysis

### User Pain Points

1. **Cannot split bills within the app:** Young people usually watch movies together with their friends. And in most cases, have to split the bill afterward on a different platform.

2. **Cannot order food during the movie:** During the movie, users usually have to walk out and buy food and drink.

3. **Hard to pick optimal seats when purchasing tickets:** When selecting seats, it is very hard to know which row has the most optimal viewing experience.

4. **Need a way to be alerted when a movie I want to watch goes on air:** If users don’t keep track the movie they want to watch, it is hard to know when they go on air.

### Create Personas

Based on my research findings, I built three personas to stay anchored on the users to avoid letting our desire for features trump the user's need.

#### Christina Lee

#### Patrick Grey

#### Pimble Graham

### Craft User Story

**User story one: Christina Lee**

Christina is a high school student who usually watches the movie with her friends after school. They usually split the bill, however, most ticketing apps don’t have this functionality built in. So they have to use third-party solutions. She also needs to share the ticket with her friends so they can keep a copy, at the moment she usually just do a screenshot and send it to her friends.

**User story two: Patrick Grey**

Patrick is thirty years old and working as a film critic. Recently Patrick’s studio want to review a movie, but they have no idea when that movie will be out in their area. The whole studio just keeps checking the app until the movie comes out. So much lost productivity.

**User story three: Primble Graham**

Primble is a uber driver who loves watching movies in the theater. One day, he watches a movie in the theatre and feels hungry. He then goes out and orders some popcorn and coke lines up for over 10 minutes and misses the scene where the protagonist got shot. He has to rewatch the movie again at home.

You can also see the user journey maps <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rWDzOFcCPbihcDvvTwJefLQ2FWnHeF5zN710AiEdlfU/edit?usp=sharing" target="__blank">here</a>.

### Problem Statements Based on Personas

<img src="/images/fortickets/problemstatements.png" style="float: right" width="400" />

1. Christina is a high school student who needs to split the bill easily with her friend because she usually pre-pay the tickets for the group.
2. Patrick is a film critic who needs to know the exact release time of the latest movie because his studio wants to review it at the first second.
3. Pimble is a uber driver who needs to purchase popcorn and coke during a movie because he might miss important action if he go out and buy food.

### Competitive Audit

A comprehensive competitive audit was carried out on 4 products: Cineplex, Imagine Cinemas, Ticket Master, and SeatGeek.

You can view the full competitive audit report on my <a href="https://itsmytyp.notion.site/Competitive-Audit-93d1596d7d4740bbb85cd110fb6f02cf" target="__blank">Notion</a>.

### Build Goal Statements

1. Our Fortickets app will let users split the bill which will affect users who purchases tickets for their friends by letting them split their bill directly in the app. We will measure effectiveness by tracking number of users who use the split the bill feature.

2. Our Fortickets app will let users order food in advance in the app which will affect uses who want to enjoy food during their movies by letting users order in advance and saving times. We will measure effectiveness by comparing number of users purchase through the app vs users order the food in person.

3. Our Fortickets app will let users get notifications when a movie starts airing which will affect users who are passionate about a specific movie by letting them get notification instead of manually refreshing the page menu. We will measure effectiveness by calculating number of notifications user received.

### User Flow

## Paper Wireframe

The paper wireframes are created with ease of use in mind and provides user an instantly familiar interface for ordering movie tickets.

![](/images/fortickets/PaperWireframe.png)

## Digital Wireframe

**1. Movie Detail Screen**

- Existing movie ticketing apps doesn’t allow users to mark movies as their favourites or watched.
- It is important to have large “Buy Ticket” button as it is the primary action a user wants to take.

![](/images/fortickets/MovieDetailsDigital.png)

**2. Payment Screen**

- Users want to confirm ticket details before paying so they are more confident.
- Allowing users to purchase food in advance allows Cinemas to plan inventory ahead while reducing the line at the cinema.

**3. Split the Bill Screen**

- Users want to split the bill with their friends.
- Allowing users' friends to scan the QR code to pay their portion.

**4. Seat Selection Screen**

- Shows the best viewing zone so users can select the best seats easily.
- Allows users to select seats based on the view, accessibility, and different zones.

### Summary

I conducted two rounds of studies. The first round helped me to design the wireframes and a low-fidelity prototype. And the second round of study helped me to refine my high-fidelity prototype.

**Round 1 findings:**

- Split the bill button is hard to find
- Hard to search for movies
- Not easy to spot food ordering option

**Round 2 findings:**

- Separate food ordering page doesn’t make sense
- Cannot add more than one ticket
- Cannot order food after purchasing a ticket

## Mockups

From the affinity diagram, I identified some usability issues, and fixed two of the most important ones (P0s).

## Asscessibility Considerations

- Use detailed imagery for movie and food so users can better understand what they are purchasing.
- Use icons to make navigation easier.
- Use contrasting colors to make text easier to read for all users.

## Evaluation and Next Steps

### Take Aways

**Impact:**

This project solved some real problems that many of us faces, such as splitting the bill and purchasing food for your movie. Just like one of my pair have said: “I really wish these features can be baked into every movie app I have today”.

**What I learned:**

This project solved some real problems that many of us face, such as splitting the bill and purchasing food for our movie. Just like one of my pair has said: “I really wish these features can be baked into every movie app I have today”.

### Next Steps

1. Conduct another round of usability studies to validate whether the pain points the user experienced have been effectively addressed.
2. Conduct more rounds and different types of user research to determine any new areas of need.
