# Project Overview

I am a theater goer, frequently visiting my local cinemas whenever a new movie comes out. However, during the movie,
I often find myself craving some food or drink. And I have to leave the theater to get them, which is a hassle. I also find
myself often paying for my friends' tickets, and we have to split the bill using cash later, which is not very convinent. So
I decided to design a movie ticketing app that solves both problems.

<div className="text-4xl text-bold py-6">How can I design a solution that makes my movie watching experience more enjoyable?</div>

# Research

## Background Research

To better understand this problem, I conducted a survey and some interviews with my friends. I asked about how often do they go to a movie, and
what are the problems they face when they go to a movie. And we found some really interesting results.

<div className="text-2xl py-4 font-bold">55.8% of responses says they feel nervous when they need to leave their seat mid-movie.</div>

![](/images/fortickets/anxious-leaving-movie.png)

<div className="text-2xl py-4 font-bold">42.3% of responses indicated that they always split the bill with their friends.</div>

![](/images/fortickets/often-split-bill-graph.png)

At this point, the need is clear, we need to have a solution **that reduces the axiety of leaving the seat mid-movie, and also offers a more convinent way to split the bill among friends**.

Then I did some competitive analysis to see what existing products are out there that solves these problems.

* Cineplex allows users to order food directly within their seat, eliminates the need for people to leave their seats to order food.
However it doesn't allow users to split bills directly in the app.
* Atom is another movie ticketing app that allows a group of people to pay sepeately. However, it doesn't offer any functionality to combat the need to leave
seats mid-movie.
* RunPee is an app that allows users to submit the best times you can leave your seat. It does require users to pay after viewing one movie, and the UI is not very user friendly.

And it turns out

<div className="text-2xl py-4 font-bold">There isn't any app on the market that solves both of these problems.</div>

## User Analysis

### User Pain Points

1. **Cannot split bills within the app:** Young people usually watch movies together with their friends. And in most cases, have to split the bill afterward on a different platform.

2. **Feels nervous when need to leave seat for food or washroom:** During the movie, users usually have to walk out and buy food and drink, and this can be an anxious experience.

### Create Personas

Based on my research findings, I built two personas to stay anchored on the users to avoid letting our desire for features trump the user's need.

#### Christina Lee

#### Pimble Graham

### Craft User Story

**User story one: Christina Lee**

Christina is a high school student who usually watches the movie with her friends after school. They usually split the bill, however, most ticketing apps don’t have this functionality built in. So they have to use third-party solutions. She also needs to share the ticket with her friends so they can keep a copy, at the moment she usually just do a screenshot and send it to her friends.

**User story three: Primble Graham**

Primble is a uber driver who loves watching movies in the theater. One day, he watches a movie in the theatre and feels hungry. He then goes out and orders some popcorn and coke lines up for over 10 minutes and misses the scene where the protagonist got shot. He has to rewatch the movie again at home.

You can also see the user journey maps <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rWDzOFcCPbihcDvvTwJefLQ2FWnHeF5zN710AiEdlfU/edit?usp=sharing" target="__blank">here</a>.

### Problem Statements Based on Personas

1. Christina is a high school student who needs to split the bill easily with her friend because she usually pre-pay the tickets for the group.
3. Pimble is a uber driver who needs to purchase popcorn and coke during a movie because he might miss important action if he go out and buy food.

### Craft User Storyboard

**Scenario:** Movie Ticket App

**Christina** is a high school student **who needs** to split the bill easily with her friend **because** she usually pre-pays the tickets for the group.

# Design

I first want to tackle the problem with users who feels anxious when they need to leave their seat. I found that the main reason users feel anxious is that
they fear missing out on important actions.

So the first idea is to have a "hype map" where we show how important each segment of the movie is.

<div className="text-center py-4">
  <img src="/images/fortickets/hype-graph.png" className="max-w-md inline-block"/>
</div>

However, this idea is quickly scrapped as many people found it to be basically spoilers for some movies.

So I came up with the second solution which became the final design.

<div className="text-2xl py-4 font-bold">An app that allow users to order food within their seat, and allow group of people to buy tickets and split the bill directly.</div>

With this in mind, I started to design the user flows.

## User Flow

![](/images/fortickets/UserFlow.png)

## Paper Wireframe

The paper wireframes are created with ease of use in mind and provides user an instantly familiar interface for ordering movie tickets.

![](/images/fortickets/PaperWireframe.png)

## Digital Wireframe

**1. Movie Detail Screen**

- Existing movie ticketing apps doesn’t allow users to mark movies as their favourites or watched.
- It is important to have large “Buy Ticket” button as it is the primary action a user wants to take.

![](/images/fortickets/MovieDetailsDigital.png)

**2. Payment Screen**

- Users want to confirm ticket details before paying so they are more confident.
- Allowing users to purchase food in advance allows Cinemas to plan inventory ahead while reducing the line at the cinema.

![](/images/fortickets/ConfirmationDigital.png)

**3. Split the Bill Screen**

- Users want to split the bill with their friends.
- Allowing users' friends to scan the QR code to pay their portion.

![](/images/fortickets/SplitTheBillsDigital.png)

**4. Seat Selection Screen**

- Shows the best viewing zone so users can select the best seats easily.
- Allows users to select seats based on the view, accessibility, and different zones.

## Usability Test

### Plan

You can find the usability test plan <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XmET-60nRwxeIPesOcoFfo8igGYIfdWIxqW-MARvcJ0/edit?usp=sharing" target="__blank">here</a>.

### Result

You can find the raw interview data <a href="/files/ForTickets Usability Study Notes.pdf" target="__blank">here</a>.

### Summary

I conducted two rounds of studies. The first round helped me to design the wireframes and a low-fidelity prototype. And the second round of study helped me to refine my high-fidelity prototype.

**Round 1 findings:**

- Split the bill button is hard to find
- Hard to search for movies
- Not easy to spot food ordering option

**Round 2 findings:**

- Separate food ordering page doesn’t make sense
- Cannot add more than one ticket
- Cannot order food after purchasing a ticket

## Mockups

From the affinity diagram, I identified some usability issues, and fixed two of the most important ones (P0s).

<br />
<br />
<br />

## Asscessibility Considerations

- Use detailed imagery for movie and food so users can better understand what they are purchasing.
- Use icons to make navigation easier.
- Use contrasting colors to make text easier to read for all users.

## Evaluation and Next Steps

### Take Aways

**Impact:**

This project solved some real problems that many of us faces, such as splitting the bill and purchasing food for your movie. Just like one of my pair have said: “I really wish these features can be baked into every movie app I have today”.

**What I learned:**

This project solved some real problems that many of us face, such as splitting the bill and purchasing food for our movie. Just like one of my pair has said: “I really wish these features can be baked into every movie app I have today”.

### Next Steps

1. Conduct another round of usability studies to validate whether the pain points the user experienced have been effectively addressed.
2. Conduct more rounds and different types of user research to determine any new areas of need.
