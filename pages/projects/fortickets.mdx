# Project Overview

I am a theater goer, frequently visiting my local cinemas whenever a new movie comes out. However, during the movie,
I often find myself craving some food or drink. And I have to leave the theater to get them, which is a hassle. I also find
myself often paying for my friends' tickets, and we have to split the bill using cash later, which is not very convinent. So I decided to design a movie ticketing app that solves both problems.

<div className="text-4xl text-bold py-6">How can I design a solution that makes my movie ticketing and watching experience more enjoyable?</div>



<br/><br/><br/>

# Research

## Background Research

To better understand this problem, I conducted a survey and some interviews with my friends. I asked about how often do they go to a movie, and
what are the problems they face when they go to a movie. And we found some really interesting results.

<div className="text-2xl py-4 font-bold">55.8% of responses says they feel nervous when they need to leave their seat mid-movie.</div>

![](/images/fortickets/anxious-leaving-movie.png)

<div className="text-2xl py-4 font-bold">42.3% of responses indicated that they always split the bill with their friends.</div>

![](/images/fortickets/often-split-bill-graph.png)

And after collecting and organizing my interview notes, I found that a lot of users have the need to split the bill with their friends, and just like
our quantitative data suggests, they feel nervous when they need to leave their seat mid-movie.

![](/images/fortickets/interview-results.png)

At this point, the need is clear, we need to have a solution **that reduces the axiety of leaving the seat mid-movie, and also offers a more convinent way to split the bill among friends**.



Then I did some competitive analysis to see what existing products are out there that solves these problems.

* Cineplex allows users to order food directly within their seat, eliminates the need for people to leave their seats to order food.
However it doesn't allow users to split bills directly in the app.
* Atom is another movie ticketing app that allows a group of people to pay sepeately. However, it doesn't offer any functionality to combat the need to leave
seats mid-movie.
* RunPee is an app that allows users to submit the best times you can leave your seat. It does require users to pay after viewing one movie, and the UI is not very user friendly.

And it turns out

<div className="text-2xl py-4 font-bold">There isn't any app on the market that solves both of these problems.</div>

## User Analysis

### User Pain Points

First, I identified a couple of painpoints for my users.

1. **Cannot split bills within the app:** Young people usually watch movies together with their friends. And in most cases, have to split the bill afterward on a different platform.

2. **Feels nervous when need to leave seat for food or washroom:** During the movie, users usually have to walk out and buy food and drink, and this can be an anxious experience.


### User Flow
With this in mind, I started to design the user flows and also made couple of storyboards to better understand how users will navigate this app.

<Carousel showThumbs={false}>
    <div>
        <img src="/images/fortickets/UserFlow.png" />
    </div>
    
</Carousel>

<br/><br/>

### Storyboards

<Carousel showThumbs={true}>
<div>
        <img src="/images/fortickets/BigPictureStoryboard.png" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="/images/fortickets/CloseUpStoryboard.png" />
    </div>
</Carousel>

<br/><br/>

### Create Personas

Based on my research findings, I built two personas to stay anchored on the users to avoid letting our desire for features trump the user's need.

<Carousel showThumbs={true}>
    <div>
        <img src="/images/fortickets/ChristinaLee.png" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="/images/fortickets/PimbleGraham.png" />
    </div>
</Carousel>

<br/><br/><br/>

# Design

I first want to tackle the problem with users who feels anxious when they need to leave their seat. I found that the main reason users feel anxious is that
they fear missing out on important actions.

So the first idea is to have a "hype map" where we show how important each segment of the movie is.

<div className="text-center py-4">
  <img src="/images/fortickets/hype-graph.png" className="max-w-md inline-block"/>
</div>

However, this idea is quickly scrapped as many people found it to be basically spoilers for some movies.

So I came up with the second solution which became the final design.

<div className="text-2xl py-6 font-bold">An app that allow users to order food within their seat, and allow group of people to buy tickets and split the bill directly.</div>


<br/><br/>

## Wireframes

After I finished the user flows, I started to design the wireframes.

The paper wireframes are created with ease of use in mind and provides user an instantly familiar interface for ordering movie tickets.

<Carousel showThumbs={true}>
<div>
        <img src="/images/fortickets/mockup-1.png" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="/images/fortickets/mockup-2.png" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="/images/fortickets/mockup-3.png" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="/images/fortickets/mockup-4.png" />
    </div>
</Carousel>

<br/><br/>

## Lo-Fi Prototype

Then I utilized Figma to create a lo-fi prototype so I can test my design with some real users.

<br/><br/>

## Usability Test & Iteration

I conducted a usability test with 5 users, and here are some of the findings.

**Round 1 findings:**

- Split the bill button is hard to find
- Hard to search for movies
- Not easy to spot food ordering option

**Round 2 findings:**

- Separate food ordering page doesn’t make sense
- Cannot add more than one ticket
- Cannot order food after purchasing a ticket

Given these findings, I updated my prototype.

## Hi-Fi Prototype

Finally, I created a hi-fi prototype using Figma.

### Flow 1

<img
  src="/images/fortickets/HiFiFlow1-resized.gif"
  width="250"
  style={{ float: "right" }}
/>

**Directly purchasing a ticket**

User can directly purchase a ticket using this app.

- User first chooses a movie on the home page.
- Then they select their preferred seats.
- After confirming their payment method, the ticket is purchased.
- User can view the tickets on tickets page.

<img src="/images/fortickets/wallet.png" width="300" />

<br />
<br />
<br />

### Flow 2

<img
  src="/images/fortickets/HiFiFlow2-resized.gif"
  width="250"
  style={{ float: "right" }}
/>

**Split the bill with friends**

User can also split their bill with their friends.

- User first chooses a movie on the home page.
- Then they select their preferred seats.
- Click on split the bill.
- Configure some parameters.
- Other users can then scan the QR code to pay their part.

<br />
<br />
<br />

### Flow 3

<img
  src="/images/fortickets/HiFiFlow3-resized.gif"
  width="250"
  style={{ float: "right" }}
/>

**Share tickets with others**

User can share purchased tickets with others.

- User first visit tickets page.
- Then choose share tickets.
- Select the ticket they want to share.
- Enter a phone number and click share.

<img src="/images/fortickets/sharewithfriend.png" width="300" />

<br />
<br />
<br />

<br/><br/>

## Asscessibility Considerations

- Use detailed imagery for movie and food so users can better understand what they are purchasing.
- Use icons to make navigation easier.
- Use contrasting colors to make text easier to read for all users.

<br/><br/>

## Evaluation and Next Steps

### Take Aways

**Impact:**

This project solved some real problems that many of us faces, such as splitting the bill and purchasing food for your movie. Just like one of my pair have said: “I really wish these features can be baked into every movie app I have today”.

**What I learned:**

This project solved some real problems that many of us face, such as splitting the bill and purchasing food for our movie. Just like one of my pair has said: “I really wish these features can be baked into every movie app I have today”.

### Next Steps

1. Conduct another round of usability studies to validate whether the pain points the user experienced have been effectively addressed.
2. Conduct more rounds and different types of user research to determine any new areas of need.
