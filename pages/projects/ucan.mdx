# Project Overview

Ucan is a mobile app that helps university students to find movitation to go to class.
We achieve this by giving users a virtual plant they can grow.
Each time the user achieves their goal (usually attending a class or event),
they are awarded with crystals that makes their plant larger. It is a course project for INF1602 - User Experience Design.

# Research

Initially, we conducted interviews and surveys to understand the needs of university students.

## Surveys

We utilized Google Form that contained 10 multiple/single choice questions to collect data.
In the end, we collected 17 responses. All participants are either undergraduate or
graduate students at the University of Toronto.

<div className="text-3xl text-bold py-6">Over 75% of respondents said they experience most negative emotions during winter.</div>

<div className="text-3xl text-bold py-6">Most participants indicated that they have trouble participating activities that require them to go outside.</div>

## Interviews

We also conducted mutliple interviews with university students to understand their needs and pain points.

After the interviews, we created an [affinity diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JXgODijrkSbgxs1_hXLvyR7kk_bxNd5F/view) to summarize the findings.

- All participants said that winter is a lack of sunlight, which leads to more depressive feelings. 3 of them pointed out those factors that cause procrastination.
- Eating comfort food, listening to music, reading books, and playing games are effective mitigating methods. Each of the terms was mentioned by at least 2 participants.
- 7 participants stated that they generally overcome unpleasant emotions by talking to friends and family.
- 8 out of 9 participants thought their coping methods were less effective in winter by comparing with the same method in other seasons.
- When participants feel depressed, they are more willing to privately seek help online or reach out to family and friends. 3 participants tried to seek help from UofT mental health support resources.
- All participants believe that the current UofT resource cannot support their negative feelings related to the winter season. 6 of them think UofT should better inform the available resources to students.

# Design

## Brainstorm & Storyboard

We brainstormed and created a storyboard to better understand the user flow of the app. Following are our initial storyboards.

    </div>
    <div>

    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="/images/ucan/storyboard-3.png" />
    </div>
</Carousel>

## Mid-Fi Prototype

We also created mid-fi prototype so we can better test our ideas.

You can find the prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ZxdNity80N5AqEKQY8HdYI/INF1602-group-project?node-id=171%3A325&t=g9dkB0x6sUVglKii-1).

# Evaluation

After the mid-fi prototype, we conducted usability tests to verify our design. Following are some important results from the usability test sessions.

We found that most users were satisfied with our overall design. However, we do have some issue with the reward system, as 40% of the users don't think it is enough to motivate them to attend classes.

# Skills and Lessons Learned

During this project, I learned a lot of new skills and lessons.

- Learned how to conduct usability tests and how to analyze the results.
- Learned how to create a storyboard and mid-fi prototype.
- Learned how to use Figma to create a prototype.
- Learned how to use Miro to create an affinity diagram.

During this project, I also undertood the important of designing products and services to meet the needs of users, in another word **user-centered design**. I learned that I need to always put users first.

# Next Steps

- Adjust the reward system: to make user cares more about the rewards
- Rethink of raising the virtual plant: are pets more attractive to users?
- Make a connection between virtual plant and Can message functions, or reassess Can feature
- Redesign event list and goal list so user doesnâ€™t confuse the two
