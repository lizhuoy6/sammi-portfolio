# Project Overview

Centro is your financial planner. It helps you commit to long-term financial strategies that involve setting goals, accumulating assets, managing expenses, and investing. 

The app is scheduled to be launched in January 2023, you can sign up to our newsletter [here](https://getcentro.com/).

## My Role

My primary role is designing the user experience and user interface of the app. I also work closely with the product team to define the product roadmap and prioritize features.

In the research front, I utilize telemetry data in Mixpanel to understand how users interact with the app and what features they use. I also conduct user interviews to understand their financial goals and pain points.
